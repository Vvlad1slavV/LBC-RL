# LBC-RL 
Learning-by-cheating Reinforcement Learning

Project inspired by articles of [Robotics and Perception Group, University of Zurich](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/index.html):

1. [Learning Quadrupedal Locomotion over Challenging Terrain](https://leggedrobotics.github.io/rl-blindloco/)
2. [Learning High-Speed Flight in the Wild](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/AgileAutonomy.html)
3. and etc

where used **privileged learning strategy** proposed in the article [Learning by Cheating](https://github.com/dotchen/LearningByCheating). 

Adding privileged information should help teacher policy find good action.
